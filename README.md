# Task-4-ApexPlanet-
synthesized all analysis into a compelling business narrative &amp; use statistical methods (statistical testing).


🎯 Objective

To scientifically validate business assumptions using Statistical Testing instead of relying on intuition.

❓ The Problem Statement

"Is there a significant difference in the average spending of Corporate clients vs. Consumer clients?"

🛠️ Methodology

Test Used: Independent T-Test (Two-tailed).

Library: Python scipy.stats.

📉 Results

P-Value: 0.55

Conclusion: Since P-Value > 0.05, we Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis.

Meaning: There is NO significant difference in spending habits between Corporate and Consumer segments.

✅ Recommendation

Adopt a Unified Marketing Strategy for both segments to save costs, as their spending behavior is identical.
